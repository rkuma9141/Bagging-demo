# Bagging Demo

This project is a **simple demo of Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)** in machine learning.  
It shows how combining multiple models trained on different bootstrap samples improves prediction performance compared to a single model.

---

## Objective

- Demonstrate how bagging works step by step
- Compare a single model vs a bagged ensemble
- Build intuition for ensemble learning

---

## What This Demo Shows

- Bootstrap sampling from a dataset
- Training multiple base learners
- Aggregating predictions:
  - Majority voting (classification)
  - Averaging (regression)
- Performance comparison

---

## Dataset

The demo uses a small, easy-to-understand dataset so the focus stays on **learning the concept**, not data complexity.

You can replace it with your own dataset if needed.
